Immediately following the November 2016 election, we published an open letter re-affirming our commitment to speak up for science and for women, minorities, immigrants, people with disabilities, and LGBTQIA. 500 Women Scientists works to build communities and foster real change that comes from small groups, not large crowds. Our Local Pods help create those deep roots through strong, personal relationships. Local Pods are where members meet regularly, develop a support network, make strategic plans, and take action. Pods focus on issues that resonate in their communities, rooted in our mission and values.", "Website": "https://500womenscientists.org", "Membership Fee": false}}, "other": {"-L7rYz8VM684lRUOUr4p": {"Name": "314 Action", "Organizer": "314 Action", "About": "314 Action is a nonprofit that was founded by members of the STEM community, grassroots supporters and political activists. 314 helps empower scientists to run for office equipping them with financial and political resources to help them succeed.", "Website": "http://www.314action.org/home"}, "-L7rYqdNZkZtYtFdKIOf": {"Name": "Duke Science Policy Tracking Program", "Organizer": "Duke University", "About": "SciPol provides policy updates, explanation of relevant science at issue, and opportunities for engagement in the policy-making process.
